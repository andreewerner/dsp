[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> The Cohen effect size for total weight between first babies and others is -0.08867292707260174. Found using CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb,others.totalwgt_lb). Cohen effect size for pregnancy length is around .03. In absolute terms, effect size for weight is close to 10 times stronger than pregnancy length. The sign difference is determined by the magnitude of the different group's means. For weight at birth, others have a higher mean than firsts. And vice versa for pregnancy length.
